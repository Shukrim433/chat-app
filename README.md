# Chat App

## Description

I started this project to practice my MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js skills. I also wanted to build a project that incorporated a new technology that i hadnt worked with before, which ended up being socket.IO, which is used for real-time applications like chat-applications.

- Notification bell will ring after a you recieve messages from the user you are chatting with. (No need to refresh the page to get new messages, socket.IO will handle that)
